# Repository Decommission Notice

This repository is a demo of using NativeModules to bridge to the Tuya Home SDK within a React Native framework.

We are decommissioning this repository. Future developers are encouraged to create their own React Native projects and bridge to the Tuya Home SDK using the official documentation.

## Steps for Future Development:
1. Create a new React Native project. [Getting Started with React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/getting-started)
2. Follow the Tuya Home SDK integration documentation to bridge your project to Tuya services. [Tuya Home SDK Integration Documentation](https://developer.tuya.com/en/docs/app-development/preparation?id=Ka69nt983bhh5)
3. Customize and extend the project as per your requirements.

Thank you for your understanding.
